# Loan Data Analysis and Classification Project

## Overview

This project is an analysis and classification task on loan data using Python and various libraries, such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The primary goal of this project is to explore the loan dataset, preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance for the task of classifying loans as fully paid or not fully paid.
## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `loan_data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis and classification.
- `final_project_code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and classification.
- `README.md`: This file.
## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running.
3. Open and run the `loan_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to analyze and classify the loan data.

## Data Analysis

In the data analysis phase, we load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the data. Key visualizations and statistics are used to gain insights into the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a critical step in preparing the data for machine learning. In this project, we handle missing values, encode categorical features, and split the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Training

We train two machine learning models in this project: a Decision Tree Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier. These models are used to classify loans as fully paid or not fully paid based on the dataset's features.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. The evaluation results provide insights into the models' effectiveness in predicting loan outcomes.

## Results

The project results are documented in the Jupyter Notebook and include the analysis, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation outcomes.
